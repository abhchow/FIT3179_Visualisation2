        <h2>How much energy does the average person use?</h2>
        <p>Over all time, we can see that the wealthiest nations tend to be the ones who use the most energy per capita. We see this consistently through time North America, Australia and the Gulf States, who are all wealthy in different ways. Conversely, in much of Asia, South America and Africa (where data is available), energy consumption is quite low. This trend is also strongly reflected in China over time, who as they've become significantly wealtheir over the last century, have also vastly increased their energy usage.</p>

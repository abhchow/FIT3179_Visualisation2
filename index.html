        <h2>How much energy does the average person use?</h2>
        <p>Over all time, we can see that the wealthiest nations tend to be the ones who use the most energy per capita. We see this consistently through time North America, Australia and the Gulf States, who are all wealthy in different ways. Conversely, in much of Asia, South America and Africa (where data is available), energy consumption is quite low. This trend is also strongly reflected in China over time, who as they've become significantly wealtheir over the last century, have also vastly increased their energy usage.</p>

        <h2>How are renewables tracking?</h2>
        <p>While the world moves towards renewable sources of energy, their levels of use remain very low. Hydro has been a consistently very large portion of the energy grid in Iceland, Norway and Canada, but very little anywhere else. The three countries have generally trended to increasing this over time, but with fairly strong fluctuations across the years.</p>

        <p> Both Solar and Wind make up a tiny portion of the world's energy usage. We see that wind is loosely correlated with wealthier countries, with Australia, Europe and North America having the most wind power, but all of them only picking up since around 2010. Solar follows a similar trend, but is also clearly dominated by Australia, whose warm and sunny climate has significantly contributed to its uptake of the technology.</p>

        <h2>Then what about fossil fuels?</h2>
        <p>As we move the slider from side to side, we can see that oil has consistently remained a strong source of energy throughout the decades. The story is a little different for coal - its use gradually increased until around 2008, and has been slowly dropping since then. Reliance on gas has actually been increasing in many countries over the same timeframe.</p>
        
        <p>Despite recent pushes for countries to reduce their dependence on fossil fuels, it appears that oil remains a very large part of many countries' energy makeup, and that the decreased use of coal is being replaced largely with gas, which many are calling a 'transition fuel'.</p>

        <h2>But does nuclear have a role to play?</h2>
        <p>Due to its high upfront costs, nuclear energy has only ever been used in a relatively small amount of countries. It has only ever been a medium source of energy in most of those countries, having suddenly risen to prominence in the late 1970s, peaking around 1990. It then stablised and has remained fairly consistent in those countries, but has slowly dropped off in most of them since then. Extrapolating these trends, it seems unlikely that nuclear will move into the spotlight as a prominent technology internationally.</p>
        
        <p>Notably, Japan was already transitioning away from nuclear power when the infamous Fukushima Disaster occurred in 2011, and they swiftly accelerated this transition after that. Despite this, their use of fossil fuels hasn't actually dropped to zero, and has remained at under 2MWh per capita since.</p>

        <h2>Total energy consumption has been rising!</h2>
        <p>It looks like Australia has been on a pretty relentless march towards more consumption, until 2020. The total enegry has gone up almost every year, and the same for almost every source of energy! Coal is the main exception with its use peaking in 2008. The last two years of the pandemic also appear to have caused a drop in energy usage, but will this continue?</p>

        <h2>A changing mix</h2>
        <p>Since 2008, coal has been steadily decreasing in use. But despite efforts to increase renewable energies, it's quite clear that the uptake in solar and wind hasn't fuly offset these drops in coal usage, and that they've been aided by more use of oil and gas. </p>

        <p id="caseStudyT">So we know that Australia is still increasing its usage of oil and gas despite wanting to move towards renewables. But Australia's population has been steadily increasing over this time - so are the increases in energy usage making the story look worse than it is?</p>

        <h2>Well yes, but no.</h2>
        <p>Normalising the data for population makes the story look even better for coal - we're definitely moving away from it. But oil has remained a very steady source of energy for the country, and reliance on gas has even been steadily increasing.</p>

      <div class="description description-right">
        <h2>Renewables aren't actually doing that well!</h2>
        <p>The increase in renewables is actually pretty small considering the rest of the energy mix. Solar and wind and slowly picking up and definitely increasing a lot in popularity, but hydro has stagnated and even fallen a little bit. Gas is actually offsetting more of the coal energy than renewables are - so we still have a long way to go!</p>
